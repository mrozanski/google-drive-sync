# Feature: Limited scope access for autonomous agent environments

If this CLI is deployed to a box running an autonomous agent, (i.e. OPenClaw) it should only have limited scope access to the Google Drive folder.

# Scope of this feature

- Document instrutions to create Oauth credentials for a limited scope access
- Implement option at configuration level so the tool "knows" it is running in a limited scope environment
