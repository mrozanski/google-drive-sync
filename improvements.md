# Improvement option to exit the tool

When in interactive mode, all menues with user options should have an option to exit the tool.
For example, 

```
? Found folders: (Use arrow keys)
 » 1. Dotsur Marketing (My Drive > Dotsur Marketing)
   2. Marketing (Dotsur > Marketing)
   Search again
   Exit
```
When in text input mode, append "(Ctrl+C) to exit" to the prompt.

```
"Search for a Google Drive folder : (Ctrl+C to exit)"
```
